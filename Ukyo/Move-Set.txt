Description: Ukyo has the same startup and hit as Issen, but instead of doing one big powerful
slash, he performs a flurry of slashes, which cuts the opponent's skin off. Yes, this is a
fatality, which means it can only be done under certain conditions which I will list below.
Like Issen, this move takes all Rage meter if blocked, and hitting this move will instantly
win you the round, and if you set up the configuration.txt properly, the match as well.
Command: D, DB, B, D, DB, B, 2K

CONDITIONS
-You must be in Rage Explosion
-You must be on the last round needed to win the match in your favor (refer to the config.txt file)
-The opponent must be below or equal to 200 health, or 1/5 health for a standard 1000 health character

==================

RAGE METER - Ukyo's separate mechanic. It acts as a combination of K-Groove and SSVSP's rage meter.
Here are a few words that were mentioned in the movelist that explain a bit more for you.

FULL RAGE = When you reach maximum Rage Meter, you enter the "Full Rage" mode, in which you flash red,
and the metr slowly begins to drain. You get a 12.5% attack and defense boost plus a free level 1 super,
but it takes 1 bar and the entire rage meter, putting you out of Full Rage. Issen can be performed in
Full Rage mode with 3 bars of meter, and cannot be performed without being in Full Rage or Rage Explosion.

RAGE EXPLOSION = When you are in Full Rage, you can activate Rage Explosion. Rage Explosion is Ukyo's big
do-or-die super. He gets an insane 25% attacks and defense boost, plus free level 1 supers that take only
half of the rage meter, and he can perform Issen for free, but it takes all the rage meter on hit and block.
Alternatively, if the conditions are met, you can perform the Zetsumei Ougi, AKA Ukyo's Fatality. Once Rage
Explosion ends, the Rage Meter is disabled, and you cannot use Meter for the rest of the match, so this move
is only used in dire situations towards the end of a match, since afterwards, Ukyo is not left with much once
Rage AND his meter are both gone, so knowing when or when to not use Rage Explosion is key to mastering him.

Move: Rage Explosion
Description: Ukyo activates Rage Explosion.
Command: LP+MK
Meter Cost: 0, but you need to be in Full Rage.
PROPERTIES
-You can activate while in hitstun, which acts as a nice combo breaker as well
-Pushes the opponent back
